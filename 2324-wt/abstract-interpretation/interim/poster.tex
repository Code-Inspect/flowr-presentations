	\section*{Project Organization}
	\paragraph{Organization} We're doing \emph{weekly meetings}, where we discuss the
	progress made in the past week, talk about open issues, and prioritize tasks for the
	next week. We also keep a \emph{record of important things} that came up in our
	meeting. If there's any spare time, Florian often tells me about new
	\sout{weird}cool things he learned about the R language.
	\paragraph{Tech Stack} \flowr{} is developed with \emph{TypeScript}, then compiled
	down to JavaScript with Node.js as its runtime. While we use different libraries for
	utilitarian tasks --- like chai for assertions, mocha for tests, or tslog for
	logging --- all major functionalities are implemented \emph{by hand}. This includes
	the abstract interpretation itself.
	\paragraph{QA} To ensure the employment of best practices, we always do \emph{code
	reviews} on pull requests. This massively helps with keeping the code easy to
	understand and well readable.\par
	If an error slips through during the review, rest assured that one of \flowr's
	extensive suite of over \emph{1000 tests} will certainly catch it. Additionally, we
	consistently introduce new tests promptly whenever there is new code in the
	project.\par
	We also make heavy use of \emph{assertions} --- or how we call them:~guards ---
	whenever possible to make sure our mental model aligns with the actual execution of
	the code.
	\paragraph{Documentation} \flowr's documentation is split into two parts:
	\begin{enumerate*}
		\item a \emph{user facing} documentation hosted in a GitHub wiki and
		\item a \emph{developer facing} documentation built from inline comments
	\end{enumerate*}. % TODO more on docs
