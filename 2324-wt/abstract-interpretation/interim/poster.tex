		\section*{How abstract interpretation fits into \flowr}
		\paragraph{\flowr}\flowr{} is a static \emph{dataflow analyzer} and
		\emph{program slicer} for the R language. Program slicers reduce a given program
		to a set of statements --- the so called slices --- that influence a variable at
		a specific point in the program --- the slicing criterion. \flowr{} formulates
		the slicing as a reachability problem on the dataflow graph, which itself is
		based on the abstract syntax tree of the given R~program.
		\paragraph{Abstract Interpretation} Abstract interpretation is all about
		figuring out \emph{runtime properties} of a given program without actually
		executing it. These properties include aspects like the sign or nullness of a
		variable. For now we decided to limit ourselves to determining the \emph{domain
		of numeric variables}. In other words, we want to know what values a variable
		can have at a certain point in the program.
		\paragraph{Abstract interpretation in \flowr} Abstract interpretation helps
		\flowr{} to further \emph{narrow down the slice} of a program. This can be done
		by removing certain paths from the dataflow graph if we can prove that they will
		never be executed. Imagine a conditional like \rc{if(i < 10) doit() else run()}.
		If, through abstract interpretation, we know that \rc{i} is always smaller than
		\rc{10}, there's no need to include the path stemming from the \rc{if}'s
		else-case in the slice. % TODO: is this okay? Or does it read like we only catch dead code

		\end{multicols}\bigskip
		We assume that the integer variables \rc{a} and \rc{b} have both been defined
		and initialized elsewhere. When entering the snippet shown above, their values
		are assumed to be contained in the interval \intv{a}{0}{200} and
		\intv{b}{5}{10}.\par
		We then start by traversing the control flow graph, looking at every piece of
		code in it. But we're especially interested in
		\begin{enumerate*}
			\item operations that change the value of a variable,
			\item assignments, and
			\item structures that influence the control flow
		\end{enumerate*}. When encountering an expression of type (1)~--- like addition,
		subtraction, and other arithmetic operations~--- we merge the operands' domains
		according to the given operation. We can observe this in line 2, where \rc{a}
		previously had the domain \intv{a}{0}{99}. Adding \rc1 to \rc{a} resulted in
		incrementing both the lower and upper bound by \rc1. When we encounter an
		assignment, we just use the domain of the assignments source expression and map
		it to the target variable. We can also see this in line 2, where the domain of
		\rc{a + 1}~--- namely \intv{a}{1}{100}~--- is set as \rc{a}'s new domain.
		Lastly, if we encounter a structure of type (3), like conditionals or loops, we
		check how the condition narrows down a variable's domain. In the
		\rc{if}-\rc{else} above, we can be sure that in the then-case, the condition
		\rc{a < 100} will always hold, the opposite is true for the else-case. Figure~2
		shows this in line 1, where \rc{a}'s domain \intv{a}{0}{200} got narrowed down
		to \intv{a}{0}{99}.\par
		Besides the domains shown above, we use two special values to indicate two
		cases. We use \ttop~(top) whenever the domain of a variable is unknown. Or in
		different words: when the variable could take every possible value. If the
		opposite is the case --- if a variable can't take any value --- we use \tbot~%
		(bottom).

	\section*{Project Organization}
	\paragraph{Organization} We're doing \emph{weekly meetings}, where we discuss the
	progress made in the past week, talk about open issues, and prioritize tasks for the
	next week. We also keep a \emph{record of important things} that came up in our
	meeting. If there's any spare time, Florian often tells me about new
	\sout{weird}cool things he learned about the R language.
	\paragraph{Tech Stack} \flowr{} is developed with \emph{TypeScript}, then transpiled
	to JavaScript with Node.js as its runtime. While we use different libraries for
	utilitarian tasks --- like chai for assertions, mocha for tests, or tslog for
	logging --- all major functionalities, including abstract interpretation, are
	implemented \emph{by hand}, as there's a big lack of libraries supporting the R
	programming language.
	\paragraph{QA} To ensure the employment of best practices, we always do \emph{code
	reviews} on pull requests. This massively helps with keeping the code easy to
	understand and well readable.\par
	If an error slips through during the review, one of \flowr's extensive suite of over
	\emph{1000 tests} will probably catch it. Additionally, we consistently introduce
	new tests promptly whenever there is new code in the project.\par
	We also make heavy use of \emph{assertions} --- or how we call them:~guards ---
	whenever possible to make sure our mental model aligns with the actual execution of
	the code.
	\paragraph{Documentation} \flowr's documentation is split into two parts:
	\begin{enumerate*}
		\item a \emph{user facing} documentation hosted in a GitHub wiki and
		\item a \emph{developer facing} documentation built from inline comments
	\end{enumerate*}. % TODO more on docs
	\section*{Future Work}
	Well, there's still \emph{a lot to do}! We barely support the example shown here and
	we also don't yet modify the dataflow graph in any way.\par As a first step, we need
	to implement support for more control structures and operators. When this is done
	and basic cases are handled well, we can start modifying the dataflow graph and
	through that, narrow down the slices \flowr{} produces. As a last step, there are
	many things that can be optimized, like the representation of domains. While this is
	definitely not mission critical, good performance is always a nice thing to have.
